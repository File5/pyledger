The status chain
================

Pyledger does not use a blockchain or any similar protocol because its not
distributed nature makes it very unefficient. The internal storage for every
contract is not divided in blocks, and each state is stored as soon as it is
sent to the server.

One of the important features of the blockchain is that it is impossible for
anyone, even the owner of the data, to tamper with its contents.
